  "Tutorial_0_Step_27": "Feral zombies are a little weaker, but they are super fast - they can attack as soon as they land in the battleground!",

  "Tutorial_1_Step_2": "Hmm, one more hit and it's game over. \nThe enemy has one intimidating General zombie in play too, \n...not good at all.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_3": "YES! Exactly what we needed!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_4": "Let's drop the big one! <b><color=\"orange\"><u>General</u></color></b> Cherno-bill - and MELT, MELT!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_5": "To do that you need 11 Goo. \nRight now, you only have 10.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_6": "Good thing you got Zeptic, \nhe's a <b><color=\"orange\"><u>Goo-Carrier</u></color></b>.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_7": "Goo-Carriers give you extra goo to spend for this turn only! \nThis effect is called <b><color=\"orange\"><u>Overflow</u></color></b>.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_8": "Remember, only Goo-Carriers of the same element as your Overlord will work.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_9": "Overflow is for this turn only, and comes with some setbacks. \nSo... it's a calculated risk!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_10": "Each goo-carrier has it's own drawback depending on \nit's elemental faction",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_11": "Toxic zombies specialize in dealing extra damage.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_12": "For example, Toxic Goo-carriers deal damage to your own Overlord.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_13": "Go ahead, let’s drag Zeptic into play and get Overflow going!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_14": "Great! ...zz-plan iz unfolding! muhaha",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_15": "We have the goo to drop the big one! \nLet’s show the enemy Overlord how it's done!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_16": "OH, DID YOU SEE THAT?!?!?",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_17": "Check that out - your Poizoms got +1 Attack and the Destroy ability!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_18": "This is the <b><color=\"orange\"><u>Ranks System</u></color></b> at work.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_19": "See - we have ranks in the zombie army, the higher their rank the rarer and more powerful they are!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_20": "Minions are naturally the weakest, followed by Officers, \nthen Commanders and finally the fearsome Generals!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_21": "Now, when we have a higher ranking \nzombie in play the lower ranks of its \nelement get buffed. \nThe higher the rank, \nthe stronger the buff.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_22": "Just remember - each of the 6 elements causes a different effect.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_23": "For instance, Toxic Generals like Cherno-bill give 3 lower ranking toxic zombies +1 Attack and the Destroy ability.",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_24": "See - now we have a super motivated squad of Poizoms ready for the final blow!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_25": "Oh, by the way, did I mention that these rank buffs stack?",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_26": "So you can get a crazy combo if you plan it right!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_27": "Well, what are YOU waiting for?",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_28": "Put this poor excuse of an Overlord out of his misery!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_29": "AWESOME!! ...Now that’s what I call a proper comeback!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_30": "Well... That's it! The student has become the master!",
  "Tutorial_1_Step_31": "Now go out there and make me proud - <b><color=\"orange\"><u>Zombie Slayer!!!</u></color></b>",
